#  The CA section contains information related to the Certificate Authority
#  including the name of the CA, which should be unique for all members
#  of a blockchain network.  It also includes the key and certificate files
#  used when issuing enrollment certificates (ECerts) and transaction
#  certificates (TCerts).
#  The chainfile (if it exists) contains the certificate chain which
#  should be trusted for this CA, where the 1st in the chain is always the
#  root CA certificate.

  # Name of this CA

#  The registry section controls how the fabric-ca-server does two things:
#  1) authenticates enrollment requests which contain a username and password
#     (also known as an enrollment ID and secret).
#  2) once authenticated, retrieves the identity's attribute names and
#     values which the fabric-ca-server optionally puts into TCerts
#     which it issues for transacting on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
#     These attributes are useful for making access control decisions in
#     chaincode.
#  There are two main configuration options:
#  1) The fabric-ca-server is the registry
#  2) An LDAP server is the registry, in which case the fabric-ca-server
#     calls the LDAP server to perform these tasks.
