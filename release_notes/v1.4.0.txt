v1.4.0 Release Notes - TBD
---------------------------------------------

What's New in Hyperledger Fabric CA v1.4
----------------------------------------

The token generation/authentication mechanism was improved to prevent token reuse.
In 1.4, a more secure token is used. To enable authentication of both the old and new
token, the following environment variable should be set to true:

FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1.3=true

Fabric CA client and the JAVA SDK have been updated to generate the more secure token.
To prevent other CA clients from breaking until they start generating the more
secure token, the compatibility should remain set to 'true'. Once all the
clients are generating the more secure token, the above environment variable should
be set to 'false'.

Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
[FABC-174] Many commands can be manipulated to delete identities or affiliations
This vulnerability has a low severity because to exploit it, one would need to
access the authorization header of the requests. Using HTTPS (TLS) eliminates this
potential.
