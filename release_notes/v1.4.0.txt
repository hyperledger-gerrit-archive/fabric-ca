None.


Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
FABC-174 Many commands can be manipulated to delete identities or affiliations

This vulnerability can be resolved in one of two ways:

1) The token generation/authentication mechanism was improved to optionally prevent
token reuse. In 1.4 a more secure token will be used when setting environment variable:
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

Fabric CA client and the JAVA SDK have been updated to generate the more secure token
and can tolerate FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false.
To prevent other CA clients from breaking until they start generating the more
secure token, the compatibility should remain set to the default of 'true'. Once all
the clients are generating the more secure token, the above environment variable
should be set to 'false'.

2) Setting FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false may break existing client
applications. In these scenarios you can keep
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=true, and resolve the vulnerability by using
HTTPS (TLS) so that the authorization header is not in clear text.
